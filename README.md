Annotation Engine foundation library


## General Description

Completely independent from other frameworks FONDIFY provides full featured annotation engine. It allows to write your annotations, define executors for the build of the annotation and a lot of other initialization features such as : definition of configuration file parsing, library module with start-up classes, annotation scanning custom procedures, dynamic lookup and execution elements (component discovery managers for component registration and instance, consoles and shells that allows to prompt or autorun owned format scripts or commands, module scanning procedures for customizing annotation injection, and many other features that will help you to integrate your application to the annotation engine)


## Goals

Define a base architecture annotation and configuration driven that allows companies and developers to write full independent and autowired application modules, that will cast on run time the definitions, giving freedom to describe own procedure to load annotation and components.
A lots of autorun and on-demand features are developed and it will be allowed the developers to write customized ones, automatically discovered and executed on initialization or on demand, via bootstrap passed arguments.
