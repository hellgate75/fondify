# Fondify® (Work In Progress...)

Annotation Engine Driven Architecture foundation libraries


## General Description

Completely any frameworks independent FONDIFY® provides full featured annotation engine, for an Annotation-Driven Architecture. It allows to write your annotations, define executors for the build of the annotation. It provides as interfaces (automatically wired, and with auto-wire configuration) a lot of initialization features such as : definition of configuration file parsing, library module with start-up classes, annotation scanning custom procedures, dynamic lookup and execution elements (component discovery managers for component registration and instance, consoles and shells that allows to prompt or Auto-Run own format scripts and commands, module scanning procedures for customizing annotation injection, and many other features that will help you to integrate your application with the power of the annotation engine).
It's fastest annotation engine ever, that allows you to exclude from scanning libraries and/or packages. It's completely written from scratch, including Reflections library. It works and interact with the ClassLoader(s), creating meta-types with a huge amount of features and informations from the selected and loaded classes.

Fast and efficient it provides a persistence layer for the selected resources from the JVM Class-Path and a singleton instance, you can use, across all your queries into the package / classes space (Some useful features are present into the Refletions component, interacting at the low level with the base FONDIFY® Annotation-Driven architecture).


## Goals

Define a base architecture annotation and configuration driven that allows companies and developers to write full independent and autowired application modules, that will cast on run time the definitions, giving freedom to describe own procedure to load annotation and components.
A lots of autorun and on-demand features are developed and it will be allowed the developers to write customized ones, automatically discovered and executed on initialization or on demand, via bootstrap passed arguments.
